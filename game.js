//Here's how the app works:


//There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

<button>crystal1</button>
<button>crystal2</button>
<button>crystal3</button>
<button>crystal4</button>

//The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

//When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.

//Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
//When they do click one, update the player's score counter.



//The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.


//The player loses if their score goes above the random number.


//The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

//When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.



//The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.





Option 1 Game design notes


The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120.


Each crystal should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12.
